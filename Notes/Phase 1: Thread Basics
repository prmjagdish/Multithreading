Goal: Understand what a thread actually is

+ What is a Thread (really)?
    A thread is a path of execution inside a process.
    Process → JVM running
    Thread → independent execution flow inside that JVM
    All threads share heap memory
    Each thread has its own stack
    So when you start multiple threads, the CPU scheduler decides who runs when.

 + Thread vs Runnable (core distinction)

    Thread
    Represents both the task and the execution
    You extend Thread and override run()

    Runnable
    Represents only the task
    Execution is handled by a Thread

+ Prefer Runnable (separates what to do from how to run)
    NEW
    ↓ start()
    RUNNABLE ←─ scheduler picks
    ↓
    RUNNING
    ↓
    WAITING / TIMED_WAITING (sleep, join, wait)
    ↓
    TERMINATED

    Key points:
    start() → creates a new call stack
    run() called directly ❌ → runs like a normal method (NO new thread)

+ sleep() vs join() (very important)

    sleep(ms)
    Pauses current thread
    Does not release locks
    Does not coordinate threads


    join()
    One thread waits for another thread to finish
    Used for coordination
    worker.join(); // main waits

    👉 sleep ≠ synchronization
    Sleep just delays — it doesn’t guarantee order.

+ Thread names & priorities
    Thread name
    Helps with debugging & logs.

    Thread t = new Thread(task, "Worker-1");

    Priority
    Hint to scheduler (NOT guaranteed)
    t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // 10

    ⚠️ Priority is platform dependent. Never rely on it for correctness.

✔ Threads run independently
✔ Order is not deterministic
✔ sleep() delays, join() coordinates
✔ Thread names matter for debugging
✔ Priority is a hint, not a rule
