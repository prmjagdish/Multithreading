+ What is a Thread Pool?

    A thread pool is a collection of reusable worker threads that execute submitted tasks.
    Threads are created once and kept ready
    Tasks are submitted to the pool
    An available thread executes the task
    After completion, the thread returns to the pool
    Threads are reused, not recreated

    ✔ Improves performance
    ✔ Saves system resources

+ Thread Pool Working (Based on Example)
    ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
        2,                // corePoolSize
        4,                // maximumPoolSize
        1, TimeUnit.HOURS,// keepAliveTime
        new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2),
        new CustomThreadFactory(),
        new CustomRejectHandler()
    );

    corePoolSize
    Minimum number of threads kept alive (even if idle)

    maximumPoolSize
    Maximum number of threads allowed in the pool

    keepAliveTime
    Time extra threads stay alive when idle

    timeUnit
    Unit for keepAliveTime (SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS)

    workQueue
    Queue that holds waiting tasks when threads are busy

    threadFactory
    Creates threads (name, priority, daemon, etc.)

    handler (RejectedExecutionHandler)
    Action taken when tasks cannot be accepted

    Execution Flow:

    First 2 tasks → handled by core threads
    Next 2 tasks → placed in queue
    Extra tasks → new threads created (up to max = 4)
    If pool + queue full → rejection handler invoked
    Idle extra threads removed after keep-alive time

+ Advantages of Thread Pool
    ♻ Thread reuse → faster execution
    🚦 Thread limit control → avoids resource exhaustion
    ⚡ Less context switching → better CPU usage
    📥 Automatic task queuing
    📈 Scalable under load
    🔁 Supports Callable & Future
    🛑 Task cancellation & timeout
    ⚠ Centralized exception handling
    🔒 Graceful shutdown (no leaks)

+ Executor Hierarchy (Java Concurrency)
    java.lang.Object
            |
    java.util.concurrent.Executor
            |
            |-- execute(Runnable)
            |
    java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService
            |
            |-- submit()
            |-- shutdown()
            |-- Future support
            |
    java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService
            |
            |-- schedule()
            |-- scheduleAtFixedRate()
            |-- scheduleWithFixedDelay()
    ⚙ Implementation Classes
    ThreadPoolExecutor
            |
            |-- newFixedThreadPool
            |-- newCachedThreadPool
            |-- newSingleThreadExecutor


    ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
            |
            |-- newScheduledThreadPool

    👉 Executors methods are factory helpers
    👉 Internally, everything uses ThreadPoolExecutor

+ CustomThreadFactory (From Example)
    Purpose:
    Control how threads are created
    Set thread name, priority, daemon flag

+ RejectedExecutionHandler (From Example)
    Used when:
    All threads are busy
    Queue is full
    Max thread limit reached

    ✔ Prevents system overload
    ✔ Allows fallback or logging logic

    🧠 Key Takeaway (Very Important)

    ThreadPoolExecutor controls thread count, task queue, rejection policy, and lifecycle in one place
